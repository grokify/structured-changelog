# Release Notes v0.2.0

**Release Date:** January 3, 2026

## Overview

This release adds GitHub version reference links to rendered Markdown, completing Keep a Changelog format compliance. The generated `CHANGELOG.md` now includes clickable version links at the bottom that point to GitHub release tags and comparison pages.

## Installation

### CLI Tool

```bash
go install github.com/grokify/structured-changelog/cmd/sclog@v0.2.0
```

### Library

```bash
go get github.com/grokify/structured-changelog@v0.2.0
```

## New Features

### GitHub Version Reference Links

The rendered Markdown now includes reference-style links at the bottom, following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) canonical format:

**Before (v0.1.0):**

```markdown
## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- New feature
```

**After (v0.2.0):**

```markdown
## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- New feature

[1.2.0]: https://github.com/owner/repo/compare/v1.1.0...v1.2.0
[1.1.0]: https://github.com/owner/repo/releases/tag/v1.1.0
```

### Link Types

| Release Type | URL Format |
|--------------|------------|
| First release | `/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z` |
| Subsequent releases | `/compare/vPrev...vCurrent` |
| Unreleased | `/compare/vLatest...HEAD` |

### Auto-Detection

Links are automatically generated when:

1. The `repository` field is set in `CHANGELOG.json`
2. The repository URL matches `github.com`

```json
{
  "ir_version": "1.0",
  "project": "my-project",
  "repository": "https://github.com/owner/repo",
  "releases": [...]
}
```

No additional CLI flags are required - GitHub detection is automatic.

### Structured Changelog Attribution

The rendered Markdown header now includes attribution:

```markdown
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html),
and this changelog is generated by [Structured Changelog](https://github.com/grokify/structured-changelog).
```

## Infrastructure

### Dependabot Configuration

Added `.github/dependabot.yaml` for automated dependency updates:

- **Go modules**: Daily checks for dependency updates
- **GitHub Actions**: Daily checks for action version updates

## Rendering Options

The `IncludeCompareLinks` option (enabled by default) controls whether reference links are generated:

| Option | Default | Minimal | Full |
|--------|---------|---------|------|
| `IncludeCompareLinks` | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |

```go
// Disable compare links
opts := renderer.DefaultOptions()
opts.IncludeCompareLinks = false
md := renderer.RenderMarkdownWithOptions(cl, opts)
```

Or via CLI:

```bash
# Include links (default)
sclog generate CHANGELOG.json

# Exclude links
sclog generate CHANGELOG.json --minimal
```

## Migration from v0.1.0

This release is fully backward compatible. To take advantage of the new features:

1. Add a `repository` field to your `CHANGELOG.json`:

```json
{
  "ir_version": "1.0",
  "project": "my-project",
  "repository": "https://github.com/owner/repo",
  ...
}
```

2. Regenerate your `CHANGELOG.md`:

```bash
sclog generate CHANGELOG.json -o CHANGELOG.md
```

The version reference links will be automatically appended.

## Known Limitations Resolved

From v0.1.0 known limitations:

| Limitation | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Compare links not yet generated | ✅ **Resolved in v0.2.0** |

## What's Next

Planned for future releases:

- `sclog init` - Create empty CHANGELOG.json
- `sclog add --type=fixed "Description"` - Add entry to unreleased
- `sclog release 1.2.0` - Promote unreleased to new version
- GitLab/Bitbucket link support
- MkDocs/Hugo theme support
