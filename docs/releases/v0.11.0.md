# Release Notes - v0.11.0

## Overview

This release changes the **default behavior** of `schangelog generate` to output **notable releases only**. Maintenance-only releases (those containing only dependency updates, documentation, build, tests, etc.) are now excluded by default, making generated changelogs more focused on user-facing changes.

## Highlights

- Notable-only filtering is now the default behavior
- New `--all-releases` flag to include all releases when needed
- Customizable notability policy via `--notable-categories`
- `--full` preset automatically includes all releases

## Breaking Changes

### Default Output Now Notable-Only

Previously, `schangelog generate` included all releases. Now it excludes maintenance-only releases by default.

**Before (v0.10.0):**

```bash
# Included ALL releases
schangelog generate CHANGELOG.json -o CHANGELOG.md
```

**After (v0.11.0):**

```bash
# Default: notable releases only
schangelog generate CHANGELOG.json -o CHANGELOG.md

# Explicit: include all releases
schangelog generate CHANGELOG.json -o CHANGELOG.md --all-releases
```

### Migration

If your workflow requires all releases in the output:

1. Add `--all-releases` to your `schangelog generate` commands
2. Or use the `--full` preset which now implies `--all-releases`

## Notable vs Non-Notable Categories

A release is **notable** if it contains at least one entry in a notable category:

| Notable Categories | Non-Notable (Maintenance) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Highlights | Dependencies |
| Breaking | Documentation |
| Upgrade Guide | Build |
| Security | Tests |
| Added | Infrastructure |
| Changed | Observability |
| Deprecated | Compliance |
| Removed | Internal |
| Fixed | Contributors |
| Performance | |
| Known Issues | |

## New CLI Flags

### `--all-releases`

Include all releases, overriding the default notable-only behavior:

```bash
schangelog generate CHANGELOG.json --all-releases
```

### `--notable-categories`

Customize which categories make a release notable:

```bash
# Only include releases with Security or Fixed entries
schangelog generate CHANGELOG.json --notable-categories "Security,Fixed"
```

## Library Additions

### NotabilityPolicy Type

```go
import "github.com/grokify/structured-changelog/changelog"

// Use default policy
policy := changelog.DefaultNotabilityPolicy()

// Custom policy
policy := changelog.NewNotabilityPolicy([]string{"Security", "Added", "Fixed"})

// Check if a release is notable
if release.IsNotable(policy) {
    // Has user-facing changes
}
```

### Renderer Options

```go
import "github.com/grokify/structured-changelog/renderer"

// Default: notable only
opts := renderer.DefaultOptions()

// Include all releases
opts := renderer.DefaultOptions().WithNotableOnly(false)

// Custom notability
opts := renderer.DefaultOptions().
    WithNotabilityPolicy(changelog.NewNotabilityPolicy([]string{"Security"}))
```

### New Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Release.IsNotable(policy)` | Returns true if release has entries in notable categories |
| `Release.HasCategory(name)` | Returns true if release has entries in the named category |
| `DefaultNotabilityPolicy()` | Returns policy with default notable categories |
| `NewNotabilityPolicy(cats)` | Creates policy with custom notable categories |

### Config Changes

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Config.AllReleases` | Set to true to include all releases |
| `Config.NotableCategories` | Custom list of notable category names |

## Preset Behavior

| Preset | Notable Only? | Description |

| `core` | Yes | KACL types only, notable releases |
| `standard` | Yes | Standard tier, notable releases |

## Use Cases

### User-Facing Changelog

The default behavior now produces a changelog focused on what users care about:

```bash
# Generate user-facing changelog (default)
schangelog generate CHANGELOG.json -o CHANGELOG.md
```

### Complete Archive

For complete history including all maintenance releases:

```bash
# Generate complete changelog
schangelog generate CHANGELOG.json -o CHANGELOG.md --all-releases
```
