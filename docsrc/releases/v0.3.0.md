# Release Notes v0.3.0

**Release Date:** January 4, 2026

## Overview

This release adds pre-built binary distribution via GoReleaser and Homebrew, making installation easier across Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms.

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux) - New!

```bash
brew tap grokify/tap
brew install structured-changelog
```

Both `schangelog` and `structured-changelog` commands are available after installation.

### Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/grokify/structured-changelog/cmd/schangelog@v0.3.0
```

### Direct Download

Pre-built binaries are available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/grokify/structured-changelog/releases/tag/v0.3.0) page for:

| OS | Architecture |
|----|--------------|
| Linux | amd64, arm64 |
| macOS | amd64 (Intel), arm64 (Apple Silicon) |
| Windows | amd64, arm64 |

## New Features

### Homebrew Distribution

Install `schangelog` via Homebrew with a single command:

```bash
brew tap grokify/tap
brew install structured-changelog
```

The formula installs both command names:

- `schangelog` - Short form for daily use
- `structured-changelog` - Long form matching the project name

```bash
# Both work identically
schangelog version
structured-changelog version
```

### Multi-Platform Binary Releases

GoReleaser now builds binaries for 6 platform combinations:

| Platform | Archive Format |
|----------|----------------|
| `linux_amd64` | `.tar.gz` |
| `linux_arm64` | `.tar.gz` |
| `darwin_amd64` | `.tar.gz` |
| `darwin_arm64` | `.tar.gz` |
| `windows_amd64` | `.zip` |
| `windows_arm64` | `.zip` |

Each release includes:

- Pre-compiled binary
- README.md
- LICENSE
- CHANGELOG.md
- SHA256 checksums

### Automated Release Workflow

New releases are automatically built when a version tag is pushed:

```bash
git tag v0.3.0
git push origin v0.3.0
```

The GitHub Actions workflow:

1. Builds binaries for all platforms
2. Creates GitHub release with assets
3. Updates Homebrew formula in [grokify/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/grokify/homebrew-tap)

## Build Configuration

### GoReleaser

The `.goreleaser.yaml` configuration includes:

- CGO disabled for static binaries
- Version/commit/date injection via ldflags
- Automatic changelog generation (excludes docs/test/chore commits)
- Homebrew formula auto-update

### Version Information

The CLI now displays build metadata:

```bash
$ schangelog version
schangelog 0.3.0
  commit: abc1234
  built:  2026-01-04T12:00:00Z
```

## Migration from v0.2.0

No breaking changes. Existing `go install` users can continue using that method, or switch to Homebrew:

```bash
# Remove Go-installed binary (optional)
rm $(which schangelog)

# Install via Homebrew
brew tap grokify/tap
brew install structured-changelog
```

## What's Next

Planned for future releases:

- `schangelog init` - Create empty CHANGELOG.json
- `schangelog add --type=fixed "Description"` - Add entry to unreleased
- `schangelog release 1.2.0` - Promote unreleased to new version
- GitLab/Bitbucket link support
