# Release Notes - v0.7.0

## Overview

This release **renames the CLI** from `sclog` to `schangelog` for consistency with sibling tools in the structured document ecosystem (sroadmap, sprd, strd).

## Highlights

- CLI renamed from `sclog` to `schangelog` for naming consistency with sibling tools

## Breaking Changes

### CLI Renamed

The CLI binary has been renamed from `sclog` to `schangelog`:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `sclog` | `schangelog` |

This change aligns with the naming convention for related structured document tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `schangelog` | Structured Changelog |
| `sroadmap` | Structured Roadmap |
| `sprd` | Structured PRD |
| `strd` | Structured TRD |

### Migration

Update your scripts and documentation:

```bash
# Before
sclog validate CHANGELOG.json
sclog generate CHANGELOG.json -o CHANGELOG.md
sclog parse-commits --since=v0.6.0

# After
schangelog validate CHANGELOG.json
schangelog generate CHANGELOG.json -o CHANGELOG.md
schangelog parse-commits --since=v0.6.0
```

The `structured-changelog` symlink remains available for users who prefer the long form.

### Installation

```bash
# Via Go (updated path)
go install github.com/grokify/structured-changelog/cmd/schangelog@latest

# Via Homebrew (unchanged command, binary name updated)
brew upgrade structured-changelog
```

## What's Next

- Localized section headers (Added → Ajouté, Fixed → Corrigé)
- 25+ language support matching Keep a Changelog translations
